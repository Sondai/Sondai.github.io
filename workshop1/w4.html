      "Codes behave in a very uniformed manner because without uniformity
      nothing can get done; however, codes are not sentient and this is perhaps
      another reason why they behave in this way and only this way so they can know
      behave in any other wild way regardless of the code. Codes always behave like 
      tracks or a uniform line even if it does not appear to be. All codes boil down
      to some predictable language." &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain">A REALLY SMART GUY</a>
